# Relate - A Mental Health Social App

## Overview

---

One thing to note is that Relate is not trying to be the next Facebook or Twitter but rather be a place we seek asylum when life gets the best of us.

Relate is a Social Mental Health App platform designed to provide a safe space, support and assistance to individuals struggling with Depression or addiction.

The app allows users to create an account as either a regular user or a professional account for users such as therapists or psychologists. (Currently, the professional account are still lacking in features)

It offers various features such as posting, relating to other users' posts (this is similar to a like or reaction on other platforms), reporting offensive content, joining and leaving community groups, accessing a list of professionals, finding wellness centres, and starting a self-recovery journey plan.

⚠️ Please note that this version of Relate is still in the early alpha stages and does not represent the final product of the app ⚠️
